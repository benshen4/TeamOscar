    <h1> Project Name</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p> In this short Unity project, we have aimed to create an augmented reality experience which teaches users about the negative effects that  </p>
    <p> plastics have on our environment. Utilising interactive elements, the user can help to clean up their surroundings. </p>
